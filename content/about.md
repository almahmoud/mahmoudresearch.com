# About

I'm **Alexandru (Alex) Mahmoud** – an independent cloud & research software engineer focused on reproducible, automated, open science infrastructure.

SIREN: `990 047 938`

## Core Open Science Roles

- **Bioconductor** Core Engineer (<https://bioconductor.org>): container & cloud architecture, build / binary modernization, workshop + identity platforms, multi-cloud deployment pipelines.
- **Galaxy Project** team member (<https://galaxyproject.org>): Kubernetes & Helm stacks, CVMFS‑CSI integration, scalable CI/CD, secure on-demand platforms for genomics workflows.
- **NHGRI AnVIL Project** (<https://anvilproject.org>): Led integration of Bioconductor & Galaxy into Terra (GCP/Azure) secure research environments; cross-team coordination, architecture, automation.

## Selected Systems & Platforms I Built / Maintain

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| Training & Identity | Bioconductor Workshop Platform (ephemeral environments), Keycloak IAM customization, automated provisioning |
| Containers & Binaries | bioc2u Debian packaging pipeline, multi-arch container stacks, container binary builder (GPU/Jupyter/RStudio variants) |
| Deployment Stacks | Bioconductor & Galaxy Helm charts, Galaxy Kubernetes runner backend, CVMFS-CSI Helm integration |
| Modernization | Shift from static always-on infra to ephemeral, automated, testable pipelines (GitHub Actions, multi-cloud CI) |
| Data / Access | Hubs ingestion automation, secure cloud object storage routing, status & observability endpoints |

## Approach & Engineering Philosophy

1. **Automation First** – CI/CD, reproducible builds, dependency transparency.
2. **Ephemeral by Default** – reduce manual drift and lingering state.
3. **Security & Maintainability** – lean images, minimized permissions, declarative configs.
4. **Open Standards** – leverage community ecosystems instead of bespoke reinvention.

## Publications (Selected)

- Galaxy Helm chart: standardized deployment of production Galaxy (Bioinformatics, 2024)
- Bioconductor community infrastructure & teaching (arXiv 2024)
- Galaxy platform 2022 NAR update (Nucleic Acids Research, 2022)
- NHGRI AnVIL cloud genomics platform (Cell Genomics, 2022)
- GalaxyCloudRunner scalable bursting (Bioinformatics, 2020)

## Languages (Communication)

English · Français · Română  · العربية

## Technical Expertise (Extensive)

- **Containerization & Orchestration:** Kubernetes (GKE, AKS, EKS, K3s, RKE2), Helm, Docker, Rancher
- **Cloud & Infrastructure:** GCP, AWS, Azure, Jetstream2 / OpenStack; S3/object storage, networking, multi-cloud deployment tests, elastic & serverless bursting (scaling auxiliary compute outside primary clusters)
- **Automation & CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Ansible, Travis; internal monitoring & build pipelines (multi-arch, GPU, package binary generation)
- **Programming:** Python, Bash/sh, R (tooling, automation, backend glue)
- **Platforms & Services:** Galaxy, Bioconductor, RStudio, Jupyter, Keycloak IAM, CVMFS, NFS, RClone-CSI
- **Data / Reproducibility:** Container + deb packaging (bioc2u), environment provenance, repeatable pipeline design
- **Security / Hardening:** Minimal base images, scoped permissions, supply-chain transparency, infrastructure audits
- **LLMs & AI (support tooling):** Ollama, Open WebUI, llamaindex, langchain, RAG patterns (for internal enablement workflows)

Familiar (working knowledge): Go, Java, JavaScript (Vue/Angular/React basics), HTML/CSS, Jenkins, Argo CD, Perl, Matlab.

## Example Engagements / Project Types

- **Galaxy Instance Deployment & Operations** – Production-ready or training-focused Galaxy with autoscaling, CSI-backed storage, CVMFS integration, secure identity.
- **Bioconductor Cloud Modernization** – Binary/container build pipelines (GPU variants), Helm deployment strategy, reproducible workshop environments.
- **Workshop & Training Platform** – Ephemeral multi-tenant clusters with automated provisioning and Keycloak-backed authentication.
- **Infrastructure Modernization Audit** – Assessment of existing servers; migration plan to automated, testable Kubernetes/Helm stack.
- **Container Supply Chain Hardening** – Image slimming, deb/r2u-based packaging (bioc2u), reproducible multi-arch & GPU build pipelines.
- **Identity & Access Integration** – Keycloak setup, role mapping, SSO integration for research platforms.
- **Architecture & Roadmapping** – Translate scientific goals into incremental, measurable engineering milestones & backlog refinement.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Design** – Multi-cloud test matrix, artifact provenance, automated validation and deployment promotion.
- **Elastic / Serverless Bursting Enablement** – Strategy & implementation for overflow/episodic workloads using managed or transient compute alongside core clusters.
- **Data Platform Migration** – Move bespoke or snowflake environments to standardized, versioned container / Helm workflows.

If your need touches open science platforms, reproducible analytics, or cloud-native research infrastructure, I can likely: (a) help you clarify & scope; (b) design the architecture; (c) implement & operationalize; and (d) hand off with durable documentation.
