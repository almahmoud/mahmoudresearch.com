# Services & Rates

I partner with research institutes, academic labs, non-profits, and data platform teams to architect, modernize, and operationalize cloud & open science infrastructure with an automation-first approach.

I work as both a **Scientific Technical Consultant** (clarifying scope, architecture, roadmaps) and a **Research Software Engineer** (hands-on implementation, deployment, stabilization, documentation & handover).

## Core Services

- Cloud architecture & scaling (GCP, AWS, Azure, Jetstream2 / OpenStack) — Kubernetes, hybrid, elastic & serverless bursting patterns
- Scientific / analytic platform deployment (Galaxy, Bioconductor, RStudio, Jupyter)
- Container build pipelines & binary/package delivery (Docker, Helm, GitHub Actions, automated CD)
- Identity, access, and multi-tenant training environments (Keycloak, ephemeral clusters)
- Infrastructure hardening, reproducibility, and modernization audits

## Rates

Base consulting / engineering rate: **$150 USD / €125 EUR** per hour.  
Discounts available for:

- Academic & non-profit projects
- Open-source initiatives
- Long-term retainers or multi-month engagements

Fixed-scope packages (weekly sprint, architecture review, migration plan) available on request.

## Example Engagements

- Galaxy or Bioconductor cloud deployment (production or training) with Kubernetes, Helm, S3-backed storage; optional elastic / serverless burst compute.
- Modernization audit & migration plan from static servers to reproducible container + Helm workflows.
- Ephemeral multi-tenant workshop platform (Keycloak IAM, automated provisioning, cost & burst optimization).
- Container & binary supply chain: multi-arch builds, GPU variants, deb packaging (bioc2u), provenance.
- Identity & access hardening: Keycloak integration, role design, SSO alignment with institutional identity.
- CI/CD implementation: GitHub Actions matrix tests across clouds; artifact provenance & promotion pipeline; integration with burst / transient build workers.
- Architecture & backlog shaping for a new data / analysis platform (phased delivery, milestone planning).
- Performance or reliability remediation for existing workflow instances (observability, scaling tuning).
- Documentation & knowledge transfer sprint to internalize operations.

## Engagement Model

1. Scoping call (no cost)  
2. Lightweight written proposal & estimate  
3. Iterative delivery with clear checkpoints & automation-first approach  
4. Optional knowledge transfer / team enablement session
